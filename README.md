# All dependencies (external libraries) and how to install them

# Define database and version utilized

# Instructions how to setup the database framework and external libraries you might have used, or a link where it is clearly explained.

External Python libraries used in this project are json, datetime, flask, flask_sqlalchemy, sqlalchemy.exc, sqlalchemy.engine and sqlalchemy. The json library needed to be imported in order to use json-files. The datetime library is going to be used to fetch a date of the game. The flask library is used to let it use request calls from json and abort a mission when an exception is noticed. Flask is used as a database framework. From flask_sqlalchemy a SQLAlchemy is imported in order to build ORM. To be noticed with IntegrityError it needed to be imported from sqlalchemy.exc. To enable a foreign key support Engine needs to be imported from sqlalchemy.engine and event from sqlalchemy.
